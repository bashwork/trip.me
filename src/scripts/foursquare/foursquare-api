The foursquare API enables developers to build applications that interact with the foursquare platform. You can use the API to create new ways to   
check-in to foursquare or visualize the data generated by the foursquare community. Our API is still a work in progress and we look forward to your 
feedback and suggestions.                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                    
In addition to the methods exposed below, you can also retrieve your check-in history using our feeds system. Feeds are available in three formats: 
RSS, KML, iCal. See feeds.foursquare.com for more.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                    
Usage of this API is subject to our Terms of Service (Updated: September 10, 2010).

Authentication                                                                                                                                    
-----------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                                                                                    
For most methods, we require either Basic Authentication or OAuth Authentication. OAuth is the method we strongly encourage you use so that clients 
do not have to hang on to usernames and passwords but can initiate requests on a user's behalf via a special token.                                 
In either case, we require that you use HTTPS to make all calls as HTTP sends credentials in plaintext.                                             
                                                                                                                                                    
To use Basic, you should send the credentials (phone, password) in the HTTPS header. For instance, here's an example using curl from the command    
line:                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                    
  curl -u PHONE_OR_EMAIL:PASSWORD https://api.foursquare.com/v1/user                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                    
To use OAuth, read our OAuth Howto

Response formats                                                                                                                                    
You can currently request output in XML (the default) as well as JSON. You should format the URL like this:                                         
                                                                                                                                                    
https://api.foursquare.com/v1/user.json                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                    
If your URL has no format extension, XML will be served up:                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                    
https://api.foursquare.com/v1/user                                                                                                                  
We prefer that you use JSON to code up your application. Not only are objects properly typed, but it will make it easier for you to move to v2 of   
our API.                                                                                                                                            
Image formats                                                                                                                                       
Category images that come down through the API are available in three sizes:                                                                        
  * 32 x 32 pixels (this is the default)                                                                                                            
  * 64 x 64 pixels (this is what you might want to use for iPhone 4's Retina Display and other high resolution devices)                             
  * 256 x 256 pixels                                                                                                                                
By default, the API methods return the 32px image in this format:                                                                                   
  http://foursquare.com/img/categories/food/coffeeshop.png                                                                                          
To get a different size, simply specify a different suffix:                                                                                         
  http://foursquare.com/img/categories/food/coffeeshop_64.png

Notes                                                                                                                                             
-----------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                                                                                    
Distances are always returned in meters.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                    
As a best practice, can we ask that you strip out blank parameters from your requests? i.e., send "/v1/user?uid=33" instead of "/v1/user?uid="      
                                                                                                                                                    
If the method requires GET, use GET. If it indicates POST, use POST. Otherwise, your request will be rejected.                                      
We strongly recommend that all IDs be stored as strings in your code and database schemas.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                    
Some fields in the response (like lastname) can be empty. We'll try to put in a note in the method description for most such cases.                 
                                                                                                                                                    
Usernames are currently inherited from Twitter. Be careful about using usernames as a key to store backend details because if the user chooses to   
change their Twitter handle for some reason, your map will break. Make use of the uid instead.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                    
For any geo method (/checkin, /checkins, /tips, ...), we recommend that you pass in geolat (latitude), geolong (longitude), geohacc (horizontal     
accuracy), geovacc (vertical accuracy) and geoalt (altitude) as parameters. This will allow us to return even better data about the location query. 
All values should be in meters.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                    
The idea of "cityid" is now deprecated from the API. This means that all city-modifier calls (/switchcity, /checkcity) are no longer available. You 
should take care to build your clients so that they pass geolat and geolong for all geo methods.

Set your User-Agent header to something identifiable. Default identifiers like "Mozilla" or "libwww-perl/5.808" may get banned from time to time    
because of rate limits.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                    
We keep track of each unique User-Agent (app name, major/minor versions and log information included) you send us. To help us identify your client  
more easily, we highly recommend that your User-Agent fit a more structured format: separate your app's name from the major and minor versions (and 
any other identifying information). We suggest the separator be a colon (":") to avoid conflicts with other delimiters. We also suggest that you    
send down the application's version number immediately after the separator. After this phrase, you're free to include any other uniquely            
identifying information you wish (for logging, debug purposes, etc).

Fitting this profile will allow us to automatically track your client in a more efficient way. We'll be able to more efficiently generate           
auto-upgrade notices (should your app need such hints in future) and usage statistics.

Usage of the API is subject to rate limits. The limits are based on a moving window that tracks the number of requests you send per hour.           
The default limit is 200 requests per hour per method. The rate limiting is applied to one of the following, in this order:                         
  * the basic auth login                                                                                                                            
  * OAuth user key                                                                                                                                  
  * IP address                                                                                                                                      
Your application should try to play nicely against our methods. For instance, cache results on your side wherever possible (e.g., /venue calls      
usually tend to be more long-lived than others). Send back an identifiable User-Agent header.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                    
We're still learning about your apps and tweaking these caps. If your application runs into any of our bounds and you think you could use more,     
write us: api@foursquare.com. Depending on the method you are using to access our API, we'll need one of the following:                             
  * Basic authentication: your user name                                                                                                            
  * OAuth: the email address you used to register with foursquare _and_ your OAuth consumer key                                                     
  * Anonymous: IP address of the machine from which you are making calls

Returns a list of recent checkins from friends.                                                                                                     
If you pass in a geolat/geolong pair (optional, but recommended), we'll send you back a distance inside each checkin object that you can use to     
sort your results.                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                    
Some notes on how to parse each checkin block:                                                                                                      
  * if venue exists, it's a check-in to a proper place.                                                                                             
  * if venue and shout exist, it's a check-in to a proper place with a shout.                                                                       
  * if only shout exists, it's a shout (no check-in). shouts are like callouts or tweets to your network. they need not be tied down to a           
    particular place. it's useful for sending messages like: "hey who's up for hanging out later tonight?".                                         
  * if no venue or shout exists, then it's a silent check-in ("off-the-grid" as we like to say). this shows up in the timeline so that you know the 
    person is out and about (to make it easy to meet up after they are done with whatever they are doing. it's useful for stuff like dates,         
    business meetings, etc).

A mayor block will be returned if there's any mayor information for this place. It'll include a node type which has the following values: new (the  
user has been appointed mayorship), nochange (the previous mayorship is still valid), stolen (the user stole mayorship from the previous mayor).    
                                                                                                                                                    
A specials block will be returned if there are any specials associated with this check-in. It'll include subnodes special which may have various    
types. The types can be one of: mayor, count, frequency, or other. If the special is at a nearby venue (instead of at the currently checked-into    
venue), you'll see a {kind: 'nearby'} object and you'll see a venue node inside special that will highlight the nearby venue. If the special exists 
at the venue you're currently looking at, no venue block will appear and kind will read "here".

Returns profile information (badges, etc) for a given user. If the user has recent check-in data (ie, if the user is self or is a friend of the     
authenticating user), this data will be returned as well in a checkin block.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                    
If the user requested is 'self' (ie, the authenticating user), a settings block with defaults will be returned. This settings block includes        
attributes like sendtotwitter, sendtofacebook. sendtotwitter will indicate whether the default action is to tweet check-in information to Twitter   
(the possible values are true and false). sendtofacebook will indicate whether the default action is to send check-in information to the user's     
Facebook news feed. pings will indicate whether the user will receive check-in notification pings from client apps (iPhone, Android, Blackberry,    
...). The possible values for pings are: on (send pings) and off (don't send pings).                                                                
                                                                                                                                                    
Lastly, if the user is a friend of the authenticating user, you'll have access to the requested user's phone, email, Twitter and Facebook ID. In    
addition to this, you'll also see a setting get_pings. get_pings will indicate whether the authenticating user is setup to receive check-in pings   
from the friend (push notifications, etc). The possible values for get_pings are true and false.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                    
The friendstatus node has four possible values:                                                                                                     
  * friend - the requested user is your friend                                                                                                      
  * pendingyou - the requested user sent you a friend request that you have not accepted                                                            
  * pendingthem - you have sent a friend request to the requested user but they have not accepted                                                   
  * node absent - the requested user is not your friend (and neither party has made an attempt at connecting)                                       
The latter two will be particularly useful in showing status in your application. If 'pendingyou', you'll probably want to lead them to an          
approve/ignore action. If 'pendingthem', you'll probably want to just show 'pending approval' as a note.                                            
A hint: you can also use this call as a way to verify credentials (ensure that the user hasn't revoked OAuth permission or that their Basic Auth    
login hasn't changed).

Returns a list of venues near the area specified or that match the search term. (The distance returned is in meters). If you authenticate, the      
method will return venue meta-data related to you and your friends. If you do not authenticate, you will not get this data.                         
                                                                                                                                                    
Note that most of the fields returned inside venue can be optional. The user may create a venue that has no address, city or state (the venue is    
created instead at the geolat/geolong specified). Your client should handle these conditions safely.                                                
You'll also notice a stats block that reveals some count data about the venue. herenow shows the number of people currently there (this value can   
be 0).

When given a venue identifier (vid), returns venue data, including mayorship, tips/to-dos and tags. If the vid given is one that has been merged    
into another "master" venue, the response will show data about the "master" instead of giving you an error.                                         
                                                                                                                                                    
A specials block will be returned if there are any specials associated with this check-in. It'll include subnodes special which may have various    
types. The types can be one of: mayor, count, frequency, or other. If the special is at a nearby venue (instead of at the currently visible venue), 
you'll see a {kind: 'nearby'} object and you'll see a venue node inside special that will highlight the nearby venue. If the special exists at the  
venue you're currently looking at, no venue block will appear and kind will read "here".                                                            
If you authenticate, you'll get back social meta data:                                                                                              
  * stats - shows whether you and your friends have ever checked in here (beenhere); total checkins at the venue (stats/checkins); and total people 
    there now (stats/herenow). the checkins and herenow blocks serve as a live count of people currently at the venue: if someone moves, the count  
    will drop                                                                                                                                       
  * checkins - show the people currently checked into this location (ie, last three hours). you'll see shout and full lastname if they are friends  
    with the authenticating user. this block will only return the last 50 results. to get a count of all people there, use stats/herenow

* nodename - name of the current category (to be displayed in your interface)                                                                       
* iconurl - URL to the category icon (cache these per session or max, per week as they are subject to change)                                       
Note that top-level categories do not have IDs because they cannot be assigned to a venue.                                                          
When designing your client apps, you might want to take care to pull this list down only once per session (and perhaps cache it for a short while).

Allows you to add a new venue.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                    
If you find this method returns an error, give the user the option to edit her inputs. In addition to this, give users the ability to say "never    
mind, check-in here anyway" and perform a manual ("venueless") checkin by specifying just the venue name to /v1/checkin. You'll rarely run into     
this case, but there's a chance you'll see this case if the user wants to force a duplicate venue.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                    
All fields are optional, but you must specify either a valid address or a geolat/geolong pair. It's recommended that you pass a geolat/geolong pair 
in every case.                                                                                                                                      
You may also, optionally, pass in a category (primarycategoryid) to which you want this venue assigned. You can browse a full list of categories    
using the /categories method. On add venue, it is recommended that you show the user this categories hierarchy and allow them to choose something   
suitable.

Allows you to flag a venue that might be geocoded improperly. The flag action will be pushed into a queue as a hint. If the user knows the correct  
address, use /proposeedit to save it. If they know a venue is in the wrong place, but do not know the address, it's enough to provide this          
mislocated hint to the system instead.

Depending on the situation, the API will send back an error response. These can fall into a few different categories:                               
                                                                                                                                                    
{error}: You've misused the method. Check to make sure you've passed in the appropriate parameters and that you are using the right HTTP method     
(GET vs POST). This will have an HTTP status code of 501 (Not Implemented).

{ratelimited}: You've hit a rate limit for this method. Check your code to make sure you aren't unnecessarily calling the same method multiple      
times in a row. This will have an HTTP status code of 400.

{unauthorized}: Your authentication credentials were invalid. Check to make sure you are passing in the right username (email, phone) and password  
pair. This will have an HTTP status code of 401 (Unauthorized).
